# angeli’s tech church ✞

gm, hi. i’m angeli. i build stuff, break stuff, fix stuff—mostly in crypto tech, typescript and linux. no fluff, no corporate vibes, just raw tech chaos.

## 🛠 **what i do (and why it’s cool ig)**  

### 🔒 **crypto prayer**  
- messing with cryptographic protocols and blockchains like it’s nobody’s business.  
- encryption? zk-proofs? yes, i do that. don’t ask why; just know it works.  

### 💻 **typescript shenanigans**  
- praise types or perish. i write clean, mean code and make things that don’t break (usually).  
- frameworks? sure. but mostly, i just ship stuff that works.  

### 🐧 **linux operations**  
- linux systems bow before me. configuring, tuning, or scripting — i’m the one they call.  
- if it’s not running on linux, is it even worth running?  

### 🔄 **ci/cd stuff**  
- automating pipelines so i can spend less time clicking buttons.  
- gh actions and .gitlab-ci.yml are my playgrounds.
